# Clipit - A simple video sharing platform.

Clipit is a simple video sharing platform that is intended for bypassing file size caps on social networks.
For an example, Discord has a max file size of 8.00 MB, but with the help of clipit, you could upload the video within seconds, and share the link. 
Clipit was inspired by "Streamable" before they were bought out. So credit goes to the developers of Streamable for the idea.
